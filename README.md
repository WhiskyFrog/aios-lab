# AIOS Loop Engine

AIOS treats Task documents as the durable worklist. One foreground command
reads a Task's state, resolves the next Role through the current Assignment,
invokes its Worker, validates the Result, and continues until the Task is
`done`, `blocked`, or halted.

Sprint 0 deliberately has no daemon, watcher, Redis, message queue, event bus,
or multi-process scheduler.

## Run

Install the single YAML 1.2 parser dependency:

```console
npm install
```

Create an Assignment file outside the Task documents:

```json
{
  "schema": "aios.assignments/v1",
  "assignments": {
    "implementer": ["node", "workers/implementer.mjs"],
    "reviewer": ["node", "workers/reviewer.mjs"],
    "approver": ["node", "workers/approver.mjs"]
  }
}
```

Then start one Task once:

```console
npm run aios -- run task-0003 --assignments .aios/assignments.json
```

The Assignment file is re-read before every Role action. Replacing a command
changes the Worker without changing the Task or Loop Engine.

Assignment commands are trusted local configuration and run with the current
user's permissions. Do not execute an Assignment file from an untrusted
repository.

## Command Worker

Commands are launched directly from their argv array with no shell
interpolation. The repository root is their working directory. A Worker:

1. Receives the complete Task Markdown document as UTF-8 stdin.
2. Reads `AIOS_TASK_ID` and `AIOS_ROLE` from the environment when useful.
3. Writes exactly one `aios.result/v1` JSON object to stdout.
4. Writes diagnostic logs only to stderr.

On Windows, `.cmd` and `.ps1` shims are intentionally not opened through an
implicit shell. Name a safe interpreter explicitly, for example:

```json
["powershell.exe", "-NoProfile", "-NonInteractive", "-File", "C:\\workers\\worker.ps1"]
```

Node-based wrappers can likewise use `["node", "C:\\workers\\worker.js"]`.

A nonzero exit, timeout, malformed Result, missing Assignment, or Task change
during execution halts the run without an engine-authored Task transition or
retry increment. External Worker changes elsewhere in the repository are not
rolled back; an operator must inspect them before explicitly resuming.

## Limits

Sprint 0 assumes one foreground Loop Engine. It does not guarantee exactly-once
external side effects after a process crash. Review-first persistence and
orphan recovery protect the Task/Review control documents, while broader
scheduling and concurrency remain future requirements.
