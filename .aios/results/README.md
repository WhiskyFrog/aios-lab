# Result Envelope Specification

A Result is the structured execution outcome a worker adapter returns to the
Loop Engine after a worker acts on a Task. It is the contract that lets the
engine advance the loop without inferring any outcome from prose.

Results are transient wire objects. Sprint 0 never persists them: this
directory stores no documents and exists only to hold this contract. The
durable projections are made by the engine — a successful implementer Result
becomes an Attempt in the Task, a successful reviewer Result becomes an
immutable Review document, and a successful approver Result becomes the
Task's `approval` value.

## Shape

A Result is one JSON object:

```json
{
  "schema": "aios.result/v1",
  "task": "task-0002",
  "role": "implementer",
  "status": "success",
  "payload": {
    "summary": "What was changed or produced.",
    "verification": "What was checked, or: Not run: <reason>."
  }
}
```

All fields are required. A v1 reader must reject unknown fields so additions
are deliberate schema changes.

| Field | Type | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema` | string | Must be exactly `aios.result/v1`. |
| `task` | string | Must equal the `id` of the Task the worker received. |
| `role` | enum | One of `implementer`, `reviewer`, `approver`; must equal the Role of the Task's current state. |
| `status` | enum | One of `success`, `failure`. |
| `payload` | object | Role-specific on `success` (below); `{ "reason": <string> }` on `failure`. |

Results never contain an agent, provider, model, API, CLI, or human
identity, and never contain a Review ID or Attempt number: the engine
allocates identifiers.

## Command Transport

The Result v1 shape above is unchanged. A session-aware command process may
wrap either one Result or one capacity deferral in an
`aios.worker-execution/v1` transport envelope. `CommandWorker` strictly
validates that envelope, records its separate session telemetry, and unwraps
the Result before returning from `execute(Task)`. The Loop Engine therefore
still receives only Result v1 for a completed Worker action.

Capacity control and session telemetry never become Result fields. They also
never move a Task, allocate an Attempt or Review, or consume `retry.count`.
The transport shape and operational ledger are documented in the root
README and validated by `src/sessions.js`.

## Success Payloads

Each Role's payload is defined by its field table. Every field is required
and, for strings, non-empty; unknown fields are rejected. The snippets are
valid JSON examples, not schemas.

`implementer` — the engine appends these verbatim as the next Attempt's
`Summary` and `Verification`, then sets `state: review`, in one atomic Task
rewrite:

| Field | Type | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `summary` | string | What was changed or produced. |
| `verification` | string | What was checked, or `Not run: <reason>`. |

```json
{ "summary": "Defined the contract.", "verification": "Checked it against the lifecycle." }
```

`reviewer` — the engine persists an `aios.review/v1` document carrying the
next Review ID, this verdict, and `findings` as its body, then applies the
matching Task transition per the `aios.task/v1` lifecycle:

| Field | Type | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verdict` | enum | One of `pass`, `changes_requested`. |
| `findings` | string | Becomes the Review body. |

```json
{ "verdict": "changes_requested", "findings": "The payload examples are not valid JSON." }
```

`approver` — the engine sets `approval` and `state` per the `aios.task/v1`
lifecycle:

| Field | Type | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `decision` | enum | One of `approved`, `rejected`. |

```json
{ "decision": "approved" }
```

## Failure

| Field | Type | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reason` | string | Why the worker could not produce a usable outcome. |

```json
{ "reason": "The worker process exited before returning a Result." }
```

A `failure` Result, a Result that fails validation, and a Result whose
`task` or `role` does not match the Task being processed are all handled the
same way: they do not consume `retry.count`, do not change Task state, and
halt the current loop run for operator recovery, as `aios.task/v1` requires.
